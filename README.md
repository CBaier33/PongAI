# PongAI

This is a simple experiement with machine learning using the Kivy Library. The inital layout for the game came fromt the basic tutorial provided in the Kivy Docs. 
In an effort to grow my skills and try something new, I've challenged myself to turn the basic game into working AI app with the goal of uploading it to the Play/App Store. I will track progress here as I go. 


9/12/23 - After another long break I finally got this project working! At this point The AI is fully functional and I have the ability to play against the AI myself or to set up two Ai's against each other. My next step will be to format the program for a mobile app to upload soon.


7/8/23 - I have already been working on the game on and off for about a month or so now. I have flipped perspective compared to the traditional pong game because I enjoy it more and I think it will be more user-friendly when it is played on a mobile device. Currently the basic game mechanics are fully functional. I have added some addiitonal components to randomize the serve direction and to reset or restart the game. My next objective is to develop a functioning Menu that will allow for either Human or AI games and a 'Game Over' menu, before I start to actuallly develop the machine learning component that will play the game. At this time I am unsure if the game will include levels of difficulty or if it will increase as score increases?
